# belly-button-challenge

The belly-button anlaysis studied microbes that was found with participants doing a sterile swab in their belly buttons.  The study would provide how many microbes species live in the belly button.  A dashboard was created to review each individuals microbes.  The dashboard provides the demograpic information, the top ten microbial species also known as operational taxonomic units(OTUs) that was studied and a bubble chart of all the samples that was provided from each individual.
